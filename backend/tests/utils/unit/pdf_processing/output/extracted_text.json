The researchers found that, due to slight differences in feather shape, the feathers of migratory forked-tailed flycatcher males make a sound during flight that is higher pitched than that made by the feathers of nonmigratory males. The researchers hypothesize that fork-tailed flycatcher females are attracted to the specific sound made by the males of their own subspecies, and that over time the females’ preference will drive further genetic and anatomical divergence between the subspecies. \nWhich finding, if true, would most directly support \nGómez-Bahamón  \nand her team’s hypothesis? \nA) The feathers located on the wings of the \nmigratory fork-tailed flycatchers have a narrower \nshape than those of the nonmigratory birds, which allows them to fly long distances. \nB) Over several generations, the sound made by the \nfeathers of migratory male fork-tailed flycatchers grows progressively higher pitched relative to that made by the feathers of nonmigratory males. \nC) Fork-tailed flycatchers communicate different \nmessages to each other depending on whether their feathers create high-pitched or low-pitched sounds. \nD) The breeding habits of the migratory and \nnonmigratory fork-tailed flycatchers remained generally the same over several generations. \nUnauthorized copying or reuse of any part of this page is illegal. 8 CONTINUE ",

Regardless of the reasons, art collectives usually involve some collaboration among the artists.
